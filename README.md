A Flutter food delivery app modelled on the Malaysian Grab super-app experience.
It runs on **web, Android, iOS and tablet** from one codebase, and ships all
three sides of a delivery marketplace: the **customer** app, the **restaurant
partner** dashboard, and the **delivery rider** dashboard.

It runs with **zero configuration** — no Firebase project, no API keys, no
network. A seeded in-memory backend with 20 restaurants, 100 dishes, ~160
reviews and a live order simulation stands in for the server.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome      # or any connected device
```

Sign in with any demo persona on the login screen, or use
`customer@msdevbuild.com` / `demo1234`.

## What's in the box

### Customer app

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Splash | Branded, waits on real session restore rather than a timer |
| Onboarding | Three pages, skippable, remembered across launches |
| Login / Register | Validation, error states, password reset, one-tap demo personas |
| Home | Greeting + address, search entry, category tiles, auto-playing promo carousel, featured / popular / offers rails, full nearby list |
| Browse | Category filter, sort (recommended, rating, ETA, fee, distance), free-delivery / open-now / min-rating / price-level filters |
| Search | 320 ms debounced, restaurants + dishes, recent searches, trending suggestions |
| Restaurant page | Collapsing hero, info strip, Menu / Reviews / Info tabs, in-menu search, rating breakdown |
| Dish page | Image, description, ingredients, allergens, calories, prep time, dish-level reviews |
| Cart | Add / remove / swipe-to-delete, quantity stepper, per-item notes, promo codes, full price breakdown, minimum-order nudge |
| Checkout | Saved address picker, four payment methods, rider note, order summary |
| Order tracking | Live animated timeline, rider card, receipt, cancel, rate, reorder |
| Profile | Identity card, personal info editor, saved addresses (CRUD + default), favourites, order history, theme switcher |

### Restaurant partner
Merchant dashboard with live revenue tiles, a 7-day sales chart, open/closed
storefront toggle, three order queues (incoming / in kitchen / completed),
one-tap status advancement, and full menu CRUD with sold-out switches.

### Delivery rider
Online/offline toggle, earnings and delivery counters, available job pool,
pickup → drop-off legs with customer notes, and status updates that flow
straight back to the customer's tracking screen.

### Cross-cutting
Light/dark/system themes · offline support with cached catalogue · loading
skeletons · empty states · error states with retry · form validation ·
responsive phone/tablet/desktop layouts · smooth animations throughout.

## Demo accounts

All three share the password **`demo1234`**, or tap the persona card on the
login screen.

| Role | Email | Lands on |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | `customer@msdevbuild.com` | Home feed, full ordering flow |
| Restaurant partner | `partner@msdevbuild.com` | Merchant dashboard for *Din Tai Dumpling House* |
| Delivery rider | `rider@msdevbuild.com` | Rider job queue |

**Try this:** sign in as the customer, place an order, then sign out and sign
back in as the partner — the order is sitting in the *Incoming* queue. Accept
it, mark it ready, and the rider's dashboard picks it up.

Promo codes: `MSDEV30`, `NEWBITE`, `LUNCH20`, `SWEET10` (and `EXPIRED5` to
see the rejection path).

## Architecture

Clean Architecture with three layers and a strict inward dependency rule.
Nothing in an inner layer knows anything about an outer one.

### Key decisions

**`Result<T>` instead of exceptions.** Every repository and use case returns
`Result<T>` — either `Success<T>` or `FailureResult<T>`. Failure handling is
part of the type signature, so the UI cannot forget an error path.

**Exceptions never cross the repository boundary.** Data sources throw
`AppException`s; repositories translate them into domain `Failure`s in exactly
one place (`mapErrorToFailure`). The domain and presentation layers never
import Firebase, http or sqlite types.

**Use cases carry the orchestration.** `GetHomeFeed` fans six repository calls
out in parallel; `PlaceOrder` creates the order *and* clears the cart, because
an order that exists with a stale basket behind it is a real bug class;
`GetRestaurantDetail` loads the restaurant, then its menu and reviews, and
groups the menu into sections. The bloc asks for one thing and stays unaware.

**The repository interface is the swap point.** `AuthRepository` has two live
implementations — `AuthRepositoryImpl` (demo) and `FirebaseAuthRepository` —
selected by one line in `AppConfig`. No screen changes.

```

Each feature folder holds `bloc/` and `presentation/` (with its own
`widgets/`). Entities and repository contracts are shared at `lib/domain/`
rather than duplicated per feature.

---

## State management

**BLoC / Cubit** (`flutter_bloc`), with `bloc` for the pure logic and
`bloc_concurrency` for event transformers.

Three blocs are hoisted to the app root because more than one screen depends on
them — the session (`AuthBloc`), the basket (`CartBloc`) and the theme
(`ThemeCubit`). Everything else is created by `BlocProvider` at the screen that
owns it, so its lifetime matches the route.

Blocs are **not** registered in the service locator. They resolve their use
cases from it, which keeps their dependencies explicit and their construction
testable.

Cubits are used where a screen has one action (`FoodDetailCubit`,
`OrdersCubit`); full blocs where there are several distinct events
(`CartBloc`, `PartnerBloc`, `SearchBloc`).

Notable patterns in here:

- **Optimistic updates** — the favourite heart and the sold-out switch flip
  immediately and revert only if the write fails.
- **Debounced, restartable search** — `restartable()` plus a 320 ms delay means
  only the newest query is ever in flight.
- **Cart conflict as state** — adding a dish from a second restaurant emits a
  `pendingConflict` rather than silently replacing the basket; confirming
  replays the original event.
- **Refresh without flicker** — pull-to-refresh keeps the previous feed on
  screen instead of dropping back to skeletons.

---

## The demo backend

`DemoDataSource` is a real backend as far as the rest of the app is concerned:
it holds mutable state, applies configurable latency so loading states are
actually visible, emits change streams, and **drives orders forward on a
timer**. Place an order and watch it walk through confirmed → preparing → out
for delivery → delivered on its own, with a rider assigned the moment the
kitchen hands it over.

Seed data (`lib/data/datasources/local/seed/`):

| Data | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Restaurants | 20 | Real Klang Valley venues, cuisines, fees, ETAs, opening hours |
| Dishes | 100 | 5 per restaurant, with ingredients, allergens, calories, spice level |
| Categories | 11 | Malaysian, Pizza, Burger, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Desserts, Drinks, Healthy |
| Reviews | ~160 | Generated from a fixed seed, so identical on every launch |
| Orders | ~22 | Customer history, one live order, partner queues, rider jobs |
| Users | 3 | One per role |
| Promos | 5 | Including one expired, to demo the rejection path |

Prices are in MYR and the whole catalogue is deliberately Malaysian — Kampung
Baru nasi lemak, Jalan Alor char kuey teow, Bangsar banana leaf, Pavilion dim
sum.

Since the demo ships without bundled photography and must work offline,
`AppImage` renders a **deterministic gradient plate with the dish's emoji** when
no URL is available — same input, same artwork, every time. Supply real URLs
(or point it at Firebase Storage) and the same widget switches to
`CachedNetworkImage` with a shimmer placeholder.

**Offline support:** the catalogue repository is offline-first. It tries the
remote source, writes what came back to `SharedPreferences`, and falls back to
that cache when the device is offline or the call throws. The cart, session,
favourites and addresses are persisted too, so a browser refresh or app kill
loses nothing.

---

## Firebase backend

Firebase is **wired but off by default**, so a fresh clone runs without a
project. The code is real, not a stub:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `lib/data/datasources/remote/firestore_data_source.dart` | Firestore reads/writes, collection-group queries, Storage uploads, callable Cloud Functions, error translation |
| `lib/data/repositories/firebase_auth_repository.dart` | Firebase Auth + a Firestore `users/{uid}` profile document |
| `lib/core/notifications/push_notification_service.dart` | FCM permissions, token refresh, topics, foreground/background handlers |
| `lib/firebase_options.dart` | Placeholder until `flutterfire configure` overwrites it |

To switch over:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure          # regenerates lib/firebase_options.dart
```

then set `backend: Backend.firebase` in `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`.

`bootstrap.dart` refuses to initialise with placeholder credentials and falls
back to the demo backend with a log line, so a half-finished setup degrades
gracefully instead of showing a black screen.

Full walkthrough — Firestore collection layout, security rules, the Cloud
Functions the app calls, and FCM setup per platform:
**[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

---

## Deployment

Two GitHub Actions pipelines, both gated on `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`
so a red suite never ships.

| Workflow | Trigger | Ships to |
|---|---|---|
| [`deploy-web.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml) | push to `main` | **GitHub Pages** → https://jssuthahar.github.io/food-delivery-app/ |
| [`android-distribute.yml`](.github/workflows/android-distribute.yml) | push to `main` | **Firebase App Distribution** → tester group `testers` |

**Web** needs no secrets — set *Settings → Pages → Source* to **GitHub Actions**
and push. The base href is derived from the repository name, so forks work
unchanged, and the app uses hash-based routing, so no server rewrites are needed.

**Android** ships to Firebase app
`1:846777623577:android:8fefdbc82283d5ec6a7688`. It needs one secret,
`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (a service-account JSON with the *Firebase App
Distribution Admin* role). Release signing is optional — supply
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` and friends and the build is properly signed;
omit them and it falls back to the debug keystore, which App Distribution still
accepts for internal testers.

Both are also runnable from the **Actions** tab, and the Android one takes
release notes and a tester group as inputs.

Full instructions, including how to mint each secret:
**[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

## Responsive design

One codebase, three layouts, driven by `lib/core/responsive/`:

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 720 | Bottom navigation, single-column lists, 2-up grids |
| Tablet | 720–1100 | Navigation rail, 3-up grids, wider gutters |
| Desktop web | > 1100 | Navigation rail, 4-up grids, content capped at 1180 px |

`ContentContainer` centres and width-caps content so the app reads well in a
maximised browser window while staying edge-to-edge on phones. Text scaling is
clamped to 0.85–1.35 so a large accessibility setting cannot break dense price
rows.

---

## Testing

87 tests across five suites, all green:

```bash
flutter test
flutter analyze     # zero issues
```

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test/domain/` | Cart pricing (fees, caps, discounts, promo eligibility), order status machine |
| `test/data/seed_data_test.dart` | Seed integrity — counts, unique ids, referential integrity, reconciled totals, determinism |
| `test/data/demo_backend_test.dart` | Repositories against the real demo backend: filtering, search, cart persistence, order placement, partner flow |
| `test/bloc/` | `CartBloc` — conflict handling, replay-after-clear, promo rejection |
| `test/widget/` | Reusable widgets, plus full app smoke tests and an end-to-end order journey |

The widget tests boot the **real** app — real DI graph, real router, real blocs,
real backend — and walk the primary flows. They earned their keep: writing them
surfaced eight genuine defects that the compiler, the analyzer and a successful
web build had all missed, including a `Material` assertion in `AppCard` that
crashed nearly every screen, a `RangeError` in the order-number formatter, an
`AnimationController` being constructed inside `dispose()`, a connectivity probe
that could hang the entire catalogue load, and four layout overflows.

---

## Screenshots

Not included. Generating them requires running the app against a device or
browser and capturing frames, which this build has not done — so rather than
ship placeholder images, here is how to produce them:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome                       # then use your OS screenshot tool
flutter run -d <device-id>                  # or a real device / simulator
```

For automated capture, add `integration_test` and use
`binding.takeScreenshot()`; the smoke tests in `test/widget/app_smoke_test.dart`
already navigate to every screen worth capturing and can be adapted directly.

---

## A note on the brief

The brief asked for **BLoC** in its opening line and **Riverpod** in the
technical requirements. This build uses **BLoC** (`flutter_bloc`), taking the
direct instruction as the intent. The architecture is state-management-agnostic
below the presentation layer — the domain and data layers have no idea which is
in use — so a Riverpod port would touch only `lib/features/*/bloc/` and the
providers in `app.dart`.

Two smaller judgement calls worth flagging:

- **Firebase is off by default.** Making it the default would mean the project
  does not run without a Firebase project, API keys and a `flutterfire
  configure` run — which is a poor first impression for a portfolio piece. The
  integration is written and documented; flipping one enum turns it on.
- **Images are generated, not bundled.** See [the demo backend](#the-demo-backend)
  above for the reasoning.
